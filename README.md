# About

This is my version of the Gwaff for the Mumbo Jumbo Discord Server! If you are unaware of what the Gwaff is, it is a regularly updated graph of the top most active chatters on the server, and their XP growth over time.

# Usage

Feel free to take a look around, and use all or parts of the code for your own use.

To install all required dependancies for the project:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
