 <p align=center>User XP data for Mumbo's Discord</p>

# About

This is my version of the Gwaff for the Mumbo Jumbo Discord Server! If you are unaware of what the Gwaff is, it is a regularly updated graph of the top most active chatters on the server, and their XP growth over time.

# Usage

Feel free to take a look around, and use all or parts of the code for your own use.

If you would like to use my data, you can get the most recent Gwaff at http://150.136.169.40:8088/gwaff.png, or parse the SQL table yourself to do more with the data collected.

If you choose to parse the data yourself, here is a set of credentials for the SQL server with veiw permissions for that table only.
